Starlight Plugins are a powerful way to extend the functionality of Starlight. With plugins you can create themes,
add new components, and customize existing ones. Building new plugins from scratch can be challenging, thankfully 
many plugins have source code and serve as a great resource for learning the different approaches you can take.

<Aside>This template attemts to provide a starting point for building new plugins quickly by providing an opinionated structure 
and configuration based on common patterns found in many existing plugins.</Aside>
